## Inhabit Coding Exercises
### Terraform & Terragrunt AWS Exercise

#### Exercise Goal

- Prepare a Terraform & Terragrunt setup to deploy EC2 instances using a Terraform module to two separate environments (“QA” and “Prod”) via Terragrunt
- Please validate your code using Terraform’s validate command
- Send a copy of your code to the Inhabit Cloud Engineering team via email prior to the interview
- During the interview, be prepared to discuss your code
- Optional: If you have access to an existing AWS account, feel free to generate a Terraform plan and catch any AWS-specific errors that cannot be caught through basic Terraform validation

#### Target Configuration
Create all files in a single top-level directory with as many sub-directories as you like.

#### Terraform Module
- Create an AWS VPC with a CIDR block of your choice in an AWS region of your choice
- Create two types of subnets and at least one instance of each type
    - Public subnet(s):
      - Instances in this type of subnet should be able to connect to the public Internet directly
      - By default, AWS should automatically assign a public IP address to all EC2 instances in this subnet type
    - Private subnet(s):
      - Provide a way for EC2 instances in this subnet type to initiate connections to the public Internet, but don’t allow external services or servers to initiate connections to EC2 instances in private subnets
- Create an EC2 Terraform resource called “web_server”
    - For this exercise, chose the latest Ubuntu 22.04 machine image (no need to install or configure any dependencies for this exercise) for the web server
    - Environment-specific configuration (use this in your Terragrunt configuration)
      - Instance Type
        - QA environment: t3.small
        - Prod environment: t3.xlarge
      - Instance replicas
        - QA environment: One replicas of instance
        - Prod environment: Three replicas of this instance
    - Firewall configuration:
        - Allow tcp ingress to these instances over port 80 and 443 from the public Internet
    - Place these instances in any public subnet
- Create an EC2 Terraform resource called “database_server”
    - For this exercise, chose the latest Ubuntu 22.04 machine image (no need to install or configure any dependencies for this exercise) for the web server
    - Create a single replica of this instance
    - Environment-specific configuration
        - Instance Type (use this in your Terragrunt configuration)
            - QA environment: t3.medium
            - Prod environment: t3.2xlarge
    - Firewall configuration
        - Allow tcp ingress to these instances on port 3306 from any EC2 instances in the public subnets

#### Terragrunt Configuration
- Use your existing Terraform module in two Terragrunt configurations
    - First configuration should create the “QA” infrastructure
    - Second configuration should create the “Prod” infrastructure
- In each of the two Terragrunt directories, use your single Terraform module as a source
- In each of the two Terragrunt configuration, specify the differences for each environment:
    - Instance Type
    - Instance Replica Count

### QA Plan and validation

```
❯ tg validate
Alias tip: tg validate
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

```
❯ tg plan
Alias tip: tg plan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

module.web_server[0].data.aws_ami.ubuntu: Refreshing state...
module.mysql.data.aws_ami.ubuntu: Refreshing state...

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
